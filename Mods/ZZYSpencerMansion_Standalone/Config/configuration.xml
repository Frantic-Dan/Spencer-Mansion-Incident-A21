Have you ever wanted to play Resident Evil in first person? Well now you can!
STORY: Experience the 1998 Spencer Mansion Incident as Jill Valentine. Collect keys, solve puzzles, manage your limited resources and escape from the Survival Horror.

Setup:
1) Requires version A21.2 vanilla files to work.
2) I've made setup easy to follow by making the text orange for all settings you'll need to manually change for the intended Resident Evil experience.
3) It will always be night, so be sure to change the Zombie Night Speed to your liking. (Walk is recommended)

PLEASE NOTE: 
1) The Spencer Mansion Incident is a *PERMADEATH* mod, and will test your combat and maneuverability skills.
2) Multiplayer is supported! However, be mindful of possible softlocks!
3) Twitch Integration is NOT supported!!

KEY FEATURES:
1) Limited Inventory: You'll be restricted to the 10 slot toolbelt.
2) Doors are indestructible, however, zombies can open unlocked doors.
3) You cannot jump.
4) Crimson heads

FOR EXTRA IMMERSION:
1) Increase the volume of ambient sounds.
2) Set music to play 100% of the time.


Requires A21.2 game files
